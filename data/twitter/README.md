Python for Data Science - Part 2: cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci2

Twitter data set

The Twitter-associated data set for use with this tutorial is not stored within the github repository due to its large size (approximately 119 MB).  Instead, it is stored separately at the following location:

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/data/twitter/climatechange_tweets_all.csv

Notes:

(1) If you are interested in running the exercises that use this data file, you can download it to local machine and move it into this data/twitter subdirectory so that the code in the repository notebook can access it.  Alternatively, you could modify the pandas code in the notebooks to read the csv file directly from the URL above

(2) This csv file is the only dataset needed to run the twitter-related code contained in the notebooks for Part 2 of the tutorial.  The file was generated during Part 1 of the tutorial, and is stored along with the tutorial materials in Part 1.
